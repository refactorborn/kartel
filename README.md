# Project

It's a small program with functions to calculate discrete Fourier transforms and inverse discrete fourier transform with different algorithms (DFT, FFT, IDFT, IFFT).

This project was made for a 3rd year license study project.


### Features 

- Before using functions you can import image, import a file Numpy (with extension .npy), or create matrix.
- You can choose between 4 functions to applied :
  - calcul of discrete Fourier transform with direct algorithm (DFT)
  - calcul of inverse discrete Fourier transform with direct algorithm (IDFT)
  - calcul of discrete Fourier transform with recursive algorithm (FFT)
  - calcul of inverse discrete Fourier transform with recursive algorithm (IFFT)
- After the function has been applied, my program create result image and some result file in different file format.

# Built with 

The project was made in Python with 4 Python modules (PIL, cmath, numpy, time).
